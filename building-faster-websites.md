# Building Faster Websites: Web Performance 

## What is web performance? 

Web Perfomance optimisation
1. Lots of measuring
  - we need to measure the existing performance 
2. Improving load times
  - get the website into the users hands faster
3. Improving perceived performance 
  - the user feels better about the wait, or feels it loads faster 
  - if a user takes 30 seconds to fully load, but the psychological load time is only 5 seconds - thats what matters
    - if the user has 'active' weight time, they will be engaged in the website and won't perceieve it was waiting 
    - 'early completion' refers to the active phase of the weight time - what they see has loaded, so it feels like its loaded faster than it has 

Web performance also includes things like 
- analytics 
- accessibility 
- improving conversions
- search engine optimisation
  - loading speed of a website is considered a ranking factor
