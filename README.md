# Website Optimisation

When you look at web performance, its possible to break it down into two main categories: loading performance, and rendering performance. 
Loading focuses on optimising performance on delivery of assets from the server to the browser

## CSS Impact
The critical rendering path is the sequence of steps the browser goes through to convert HTML, CSS and Javascript into pixels on the screen.
By focusing on CSS we can perform runtime performance 

Optimise CSS by:
- Minimising critical resources 
- Minimise critical bytes 

CSS is render blocking by default - anything blocking the critical rendering path means the user will get a blank screen.
