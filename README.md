## CSS Impact
The critical rendering path is the sequence of steps the browser goes through to convert HTML, CSS and Javascript into pixels on the screen.
By focusing on CSS we can perform runtime performance 

Optimise CSS by:
- Minimising critical resources 
- Minimise critical bytes 

CSS is render blocking by default - anything blocking the critical rendering path means the user will get a blank screen. 

Why decrease load time?
- "Yahoo increased traffic by 9% for each 400ms of improvement in load time" - wpostats.com
- "Amazon saw that every 100ms increase in load time resulted in a 1% decrease in revenue"
